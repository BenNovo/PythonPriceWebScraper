	<h3>This is a basic price scraping tool. Using Selenium, requests are sent to Target, </br>
	Best Buy, Amazon, and Walmart to find the price of the inputted product. Taking advantage of </br>
	each company's respective product search algorithm, this scraper selects the first non-advertisement </br>
	item that is most relevant to the user's search to enable more efficient comparison shopping. For example, </br>
	try searching "Apple Air Pods Pro" and "A2084"</h3>
